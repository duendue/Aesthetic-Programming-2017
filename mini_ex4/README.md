<h4>A Short description of your work and tell us how your work demonstrats the notion of "feedback" or "cybernetics"</h4>
My initial inspiration for the design was the following video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apVR5Htz0K4.
I really liked the element of human input as a core aspect of the program. When I worked out how to get the basic interaction elements
to work, I started experimenting with some different aesthetical expressions, to increase the overall value of the program.
I liked the humour of the Monthy Python finger, and the underlying symbolic value of adding images of the actual source code. The program
ends up expressing feedback from itself, represented in the finger. Every time you switch it on, the program switches itself off.
My hope was to make a program that actively tries to hide its own source code.

I realized, while uploading my first sketch, that the code didn’t actually loop (unless you expect the human pressing the button, 
to keep doing that forever). Therefore, I modified my initial design a little bit, so it now loops forever when you press the button 
the first time. The result turned out to be quite interesting. Without the human input, the program suddenly expresses a “battle” 
between two sides (represented in the two fingers), both forever trying to switch the button. 
Instead of being a comment on man vs. machine, it changes into machine vs. machine.
