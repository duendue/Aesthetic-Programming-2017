<h5>The following mini_ex assignment ended up turning into two different programs. I have decided to upload both programs, even though one of them doesn’t include the RiTa library. This decision is based on the fact that the majority of the past weeks coding process was spent on the program without the RiTa library.</h5>

----------------------------------------------

**“The Adventure of John Doe”** was the original program idea by my study partner Casper Lerche (Github: **LurdKek**) and I. We decided early on in the process (Tuesday) that we wanted to make a Tell-tale adventure game, where the player could choose how he wanted the story to unfold. We spent most of our time trying to get the base code functionality to work. Initially we thought the functions loadString and splitTokens were part of the Rita library. When we realized, this wasn’t the case, we instead tried to implement other RiTa functions into the finished product, but we couldn’t get it to work, without breaking the rest of the software. However, our time wasn’t wasted, as I feel like we both 
have learned a lot through collaborating with another person on a programming project.


**“Presidential Speech Simulator”** was a spinoff program, I did on my own, trying out some of the functionality of the RiTa Library. The original intention was to implement what I had learned on the larger project described above, however, the magnitude of said program ended up taking up most of our time. 

The “Presidential Speech Simulator” consists mainly of the markov functions, generateSentences and loadText. These are used to combine two speech transcripts from the presidential candidates of the united states presidential election and generate a new speech segment from them. The result is a rather macabre patchwork of highly polarized statements. The difference in rhetoric is, at times, striking. The generated speech ends up being “detached” from the original author. This is also because of the difference between the spoken word (which is how a speech traditionally is delivered) and the written word (like the transcript or the interface representation through the program).

<h5>Even though the following mini_ex wasn’t completed how it was traditionally intended, I still hope that both programs are satisfactory.</h5>
