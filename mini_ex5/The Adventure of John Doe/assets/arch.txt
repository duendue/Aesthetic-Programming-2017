As John continued, he reached a clearing//And an ominous feeling in John was appearing//There in the  glade, in a stump from an oak//An axe through the bark of the stump had been broke
In doubt of his choice, whether this was too late//He wondered if the axe, had really been bait
With all his power, or the lack thereof//John pulled the axe, like a feather from a dove
As the forest got denser, and the light turned to dark//There in the shadow, he discovered an arch//With branches of vine and scent sweet and fine//At the center of the arch, a mysterious little chime
He stepped through the archway, in hopes of great awe//But it's just an archway, and John nothing saw
John he sidesteps the archway of vines//Questioning his urges, once of many time
In an act of crime//Long before his time//He chopped down the archway//And didn't give a dime
John has now gone deeper, than ever gone before//The vibes here a creepier, than the vibes he felt befor//The trees around him wrinkly, and filled with thorns and mold//Older than anything he'd ever seen, and his Granny is pretty old// John continued forward on, when suddenly he came//To yet another spot of light, with bushes ripe for John to claim//And in the midst of the glade, stood an ancient oak//Stunned in admiration,  John was about to choke
For the rest of the day, John picked his berries//He then returned home and ate porkchop with cherries//For the rest of his life he ran errands for others//But forgot his own goals, like finding his brothers (yeah he had those, and didn't know about it, mkay.)
A wild urge of power rushed over John//As he charged through the berry field, like if he was mowing a lawn//He swung his great axe, and chopped down the tree//When suddenly he was stung by a bee//He had used all his day in a redundant way//And did not return home with food, per se//For the rest of it's days the old village was struck//By all sorts of happenings caused by bad luck
Ignoring the bushes, John walks to the tree//And through closer investigation, this it what he could see//It's wrinkly bark shaped into letters of repentance//When suddenly John could read a sentence//"Eat the blue, and nothing shall happen for you;//Eat the red and the knowledge upon you will be shed"
John ate the berries that were red//And he realizes that he is full of regret//And that life is more, than just a stupid old tale//Go home, break the narrative, and study philosophy at Yale//He went home in all his new glory//But this doesn't have to be the end of the story...
John ate the blue berries in sight//Such a wonderful taste, gilled him with delight//He returned home to his Granny old//Ignorant and stupid, such the story is told...
