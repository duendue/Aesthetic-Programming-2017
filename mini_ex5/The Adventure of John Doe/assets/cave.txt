John turned west into the trees// Listening to birds, buzzards, and bees// And there in the grass he discovered a rabbit// Cute, with fuzzy ears and a dandelion-eating habit...
On the ground the rabbit lay,// and John he picked it up, thinking// "Hopefully this is not the best loot for today// But this is not going to make me stop".
	
As he walked even further  into the trees// He could no longer hear all the birds and the bees// And there in front of him, her stared into a cave
As the cave he entered, the scent of forest air// Was replaced by a foul odor, coming from the dank and moss-grown lair// And there in on the floor in front of him, slept a giant bear, now...
As John ran past the bear, it woke up in a scare// And hurled towards the exit before John could get there
Using skills, taught at the school// He sweet-talked the bear, who was quite a fool// While he entered the exit and continued his course// The bear walking away, with a look of remorse
John attempted to flee from the bear// But John was too slow and died by a tear
The bear looked happily at John as he gave it the rabbit// Who would know, that bears had a rabbit-eating habit?
exits cave safely
