As John turned east into the wood,// a deer jumped across apparently up to no good// He started to ponder what the sign had said "another attendant?"// Unsure of the meaning about what he had read// "Should he follow the path or turn back and go west?"// Somehow, he didn't feel like it was on his shoulders  to rest.
John continued onward, with a feeling very secure// When he reached the banks of a creek, with water chuckling and pure...// Or wait.. actually.. when I come to think of it...// It was a large roaring river, with waters looking treacherous and very, very unsure.
	
As John he entered the waters, he felt the current around his feet and thighs// Could he really cross the river, without drowning with water in his eyes? 
John continued up along the shore, where he stopped because of what he saw// A bridge across the running river, thinking "such a great feeling, when narrators they deliver"...
As John climbed ashore, cold and dripping wet// whilst questioning this life decision with asperity and regret...
As John continued further, and deeper into the stream// A rush of water dragged him down beneath, the waves and foam and steam// And thus the tale of John it ended, in deep unknown despair// And now what with old Granny, now that John can no longer be there
John walked over the wooden, wood bridge// Happy and sure that the right direction was this...
"You spend the rest of your day walking down the river,// without reaching any point which allows for crossing.// You realize you haven't gathered any berries for the village chief, and you start crying over you dead parrots."
