In a small village forgotten long ago, Lived a young villager by the name of John Doe
Together with his Grandma' he lived a quiet life, and seldom did he venture for to him his home was rife
	
But one day when the sky was clear, and the sun it shun so calm
Old Granny whom he had so dear, told him about her qualm
"Dear Grubblesnuck", is what she called him, "my berries are all gone"
"I need you to venture out and get some, before the break of dawn"
	
So John he grabbed his sack-on-a-stick, and ventured to the woods
Due to rumors about a glade in the forest, with the ripest of goods
And as John had walked for I-don't-know-how-long, whilst happily whistling his favorite song
He came to a halt in his travels thus far, as he encountered a sign which he found kind of bizarre
	
On the sign it read "Good traveler be sure, obstacles you must endure
Which path will you follow in the search of what you're looking for?
Right or left - it is up to you, or no not really, but the attendant of this has to choose what to do..."
	
1: Turn right
	
2: Turn left
