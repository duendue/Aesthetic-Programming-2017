<h5>What are the rules that you have employed in your program?</h5>

1. A random function finds a number between 0 and 4. These numbers represent 4 different possible events stated in a switch function. These events decides in which direction the snakes should go.

2. A slider controls the speed at which the snakes turn and change direction.

3. Each time the snakes reach the edge of the canvas they will appear on the opposite site.

4. The snakes gain a random starting colour, and then start cycling through the Hue values, thereby creating different coloured snakes.

In the beginning of this mini_ex i was really excited about the videos on perlin noise by Daniel Shiffman. I followed his coding process and basically made a copy of his code. I changed some of the numbers and variables a little bit, but the core program was his creation. Therefore, I didn’t felt satisfied by just uploading what was essentially Daniel Shiffmans code. I decided to try to use some of the techniques I learned from his video and create my own program which would illustrate the notion of generativity. I have made a link to the code inspired by Daniel Shiffman on Perlin Noise below.

During the coding process, I also talked about my fellow study mates on which direction to take our programs in. There was a collective agreement around the fact that one of the most frustrating (and perhaps most intriguing) parts about generative art is the lack of control from the creator / programmers’ side. I often found myself changing numbers on variables with now idea of what the outcome would lead to. This made it very hard to create something that felt aesthetically pleasing, as well as being generative. This is also very well described in the article “Generative Art Theory” by Philip Galanter. Galanter states that because of the unpredictable nature of generative code, the line between creativity and authorship becomes blurred (p. 151). I have tried to “fake” the feeling of control by adding a slider which essentially just changes the variables I mentioned earlier during the execution of the program. Somehow this shifts the role of the author from the programmer to whomever watches and interacts with the program as it unfolds. I always like to add elements of interactivity in my programs, because I feel like software should be more than just moving images and sound.
