Weekly mini ex8: Coding challenge and a flow chart

[Program Weblink](https://duendue.github.io/Aesthetic-Programming-2017/mini_ex8/PurpleRain/)

I selected Coding Challenge #4, Purple Rain in Processing, as a basis for my program. I wanted to recharge for the final project so I didn't felt like coding for many hours over the week so i have kept it simple. I have added a slider which controls the amount of rain that will fall.

The tricky part of this week’s mini_exersice is the fact that we had to modify an existing piece of software. We had to tinker with the code and try to "make it our own". The tricky part is learning the logics behind Daniel Shiffman’s coding structure and know which elements to change, without breaking the code. One could say, it's the relationship between programmers that is in focus this week. That is also apparent from the fact that we had to communicate the process of the program through a flowchart, to ultimately explain the structure of the modified code.

The flowcharts help visualizing advanced, non-linear, processes in a somewhat simple manner. Using common symbols to illustrate different events, one can ideally explain the code, even to someone who haven't programmed anything in their life. However, there's the risk of oversimplification the processes which can lead to misunderstanding, confusion, and errors.
