UPDATE: AFTER SPENDING HOURS TRYING TO MAKE GITHUB ACCEPT MY HTTP URL'S I HAVE DECIDED TO GIVE UP ON THE CODING LIFE AND BECOME A SHEEP HERDER.

*And now, for something completely different.*

i have uploadet a zip-folder with all the program files. It should work from a local browser.


For the longest time, i wasn't sure what i wanted to do with this mini_ex assignment. Deep down i knew i wanted to do something extra, as it was the last, however, it took some time before i got the idea for the program. I also knew i wanted to explore some of p5's elements that i hadn't worked with before. 


My idea came to me in the middle of a PÃ¥skefrokost. I dont know why, i dont know how, but suddently i just thought of the Game of Thrones booktitle, A Song of Ice and Fire. And then i knew what i wanted to do. My program draws weather data from the coldest and hottest areas of the planet, and changes the data into hz, values which then generates sounds and music.
Keeping in spirit of the theme, and to go the extra mile, it being the final mini_ex and all, i decided to adjust the tone scale so it is the same musical notes they use from the Game of Thrones intro theme.
The main goal was to explore the basic functionallity of API data, as well as experimenting with the P5 Sound Library.



**Which API have you chosen? and Why?**
I choose the Open Weather Map API data, beacuse it was the most basic and manageble site i felt. I was blisfully unaware of the fact that they only supply you with HTTP URL's and not HTTPS's, but that is a different story. A major factor was also the amount of tutorials and examples that used the Open Weather Map Api.

**Can you describe your process of making this mini exercise in terms of acquiring, processing, using and representing data?**
I felt like i had to represent the original source material of the data in someway, shape or form. The easiest way to do this was to colour the SoundBars in representing colours. The blue bar is from the temperature of the cold areas and the red ones from the hot areas.
During the coding process i had to adjust some of the data, to make them compatible with the Oscillator function. For example, i had to change the negative temperature values from Antarctica, into positive values, for the program to be able to change it into Hz sound waves.

**What is your reflection on the aesthetics of (big) data?**
I feel like it is up to the programmer to interpretet, adjust, understand, shape, form and control data into aesthetic elements. In its pure form, data is nothing but numbers, and information, and it is through the act of aranging it in some predefined pattern that we give it its aesthetic value. It is also through the action of choosing and deciding which data to use, and which data to omit that we shape the asesthetic elements.
